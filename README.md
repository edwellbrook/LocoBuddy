# ðŸ—£ LocoBuddy

**LocoBuddy** is a Swift command-line tool that makes it easier to use and search Apple's `AppleGlot` [translation glossaries](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/), which are exports of translations used in Apple's system apps, such as Maps and Home, for all system languages.

However, these translation glossaries are provided in `lg` file formats, and separated per each system app. LocoBuddy handles parsing these glossaries to search for specific terms and translate a found term into any number of given languages. 

This package is heavily inspired by and uses code adapted from [Douglas' in depth blog post on parsing these glossaries](https://douglashill.co/localisation-using-apples-glossaries/).

## Requirements

**LocoBuddy** requires **macOS 11+** and is used directly on the command-line (Terminal). The command-line interface is created through Apple's [Swift Argument Parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) library, which is added through Swift Package Manager.

## Usage

This tool requires Apple's translation glossaries to be downloaded and mounted; a valid Apple Developer account is required to download the glossaries. [Download](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) the glossary languages you want from Apple's website by searching for glossaries, then mount the `dmg` disk images by double-clicking on each one.

After mounting the disk images, search for terms in the glossaries you downloaded. For example, to search for "Book" in the Simplified Chinese glossary:

```bash
LocoBuddy search --language "Simplified Chinese" --match contains "Book"
```
```
ô€…´   Found 12 strings matching or containing `Cancel Ride`!

ô€…¶   Add to Bookmarks
ô€°‘   åŠ å…¥æ›¸ç±¤
ô€Ÿ•   URL_ACTION_BOOKMARK
ô€Ž«   ContactsUI.lg
...
```

You can then translate a specific key (e.g. `URL_ACTION_BOOKMARK`) into one or more languages, using the initials or full names of the glossaries, at the same time:

(SC is Simplified Chinese, TC is Traditional Chinese)

```bash
LocoBuddy translate --key "URL_ACTION_BOOKMARK" "SC" "TC" 
```

```
ô€°‘   åŠ å…¥æ›¸ç±¤
ô€Ž«   ContactsUI.lg
ô€†ª   Traditional Chinese

ô€°‘   æ·»åŠ åˆ°ä¹¦ç­¾
ô€Ž«   ContactsUI.lg
ô€†ª   Simplified Chinese
```
